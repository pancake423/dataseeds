Dependencies:

PapaParse (for parsing CSV files to arrays)

Plotly.js (for displaying graphical data)

Flaticon (UI icons)

#
Browser and Device Support:

Modern browser supporting new FilePicker methods (at the time of writing: Chrome, Edge, or Opera)
Other browser users (Safari, Firefox) will be mildy annoyed by a disfunctional 'add files' button and being forced to drag and drop files.

IE/mobile browsers are not supported.

Limited testing was done on monitors smaller than 1080p. The program should still be usable, though not as well laid out.
