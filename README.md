Modern browser supporting new FilePicker methods (at the time of writing: Chrome, Edge, or Opera)
Other browser users (Safari, Firefox) will be mildy annoyed by a disfunctional 'add files' button and being forced to drag and drop files.

If you still use IE, bless your heart, but I am not even pretending to support it.
